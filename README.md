# FanWar Class Template

This provides a LaTeX template that can be used to quickly and easily make nicely formatted FanWar classes and specializations without having to worry about any formatting, consistency, or other issues that may arise. Most of the material should be self explanatory, but this will (hopefully) be updated and maintained in the future with better guidelines on how to format a class. Please refereance the example template for more.
